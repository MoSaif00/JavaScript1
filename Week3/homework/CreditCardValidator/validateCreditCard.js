// In this project you'll write a function, called validateCreditNumber, that validates whether or not a credit card number is valid.

// Here are the criteria for a valid number:

// Input must be 16 characters
// All characters must be numbers
// At least two different numbers should be represented
// The last number must be even
// The sum of all the numbers must be greater than 16
